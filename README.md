# AI Startup Project POC

This project demonstrates a proof of concept for a startup idea generation and evaluation tool using machine learning models and LLMs (Large Language Models), specifically designed for entrepreneurs and innovators in the startup ecosystem.

## Features

- **Models and Data Definitions**: Define data structures for startups (`models.py`).
- **Thought Process Automation**: Automate sequences of thought using interactive LLMs for generating and evaluating startup ideas (`tree_of_thoughts.py`).
- **Startup Retrieval Tool**: Leverage tools to retrieve relevant startup companies based on descriptions (`retriever.py`).
- **Startup Data Scrapper**: Scrape startup data from Y Combinator's directory, demonstrating a practical application of web scraping for real-world data collection (`scrape_yc_companies.py`).

## Usage Instructions

Run the particular Python scripts to see them in action. Each script corresponds to a particular functionality described above, creating an end-to-end solution from idea generation to competitor analysis. 

Note: Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` before executing the scripts.
